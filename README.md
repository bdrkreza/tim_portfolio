**[RK• Design System React](https://rk-reza.web.app//)** is a responsive Bootstrap 4 kit, developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) and [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), and it is provided for free by RK. It is a beautiful cross-platform UI kit featuring over 70 elements and 3 templates.

RK• Design System React will help you create a clean and simple website that is a perfect fit for today's black design. It is built using the 12 column grid system, with components designed to fit together perfectly. It makes use of bold colours, beautiful typography, clear photography and spacious arrangements.

## Complex Documentation

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation. You can read more about the idea behind this design system here. You can check the components here and the foundation here.

## Bootstrap 4 Support

rk• Design System React is built on top of the much awaited Bootstrap 4 (Reactstrap). This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 or Reactstrap project; you can just import the rk• Design System React style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.
